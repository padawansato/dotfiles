0:37it's super easy and it's not just
0:39limited to the US where that's it let's
0:41get into the video
0:41what's good everyone hope you're all
0:43doing amazing today and I'm actually
0:46super happy today because not only have
0:48I had an amazing day but at the same
0:49time I'm also really happy to talk about
0:52Lucena Latinas actually one of the
0:53cactus that I have the most fun with
0:54playing in smash 4 actually she's one of
0:57the characters that I guess you could
0:58say I play for fun when like you know
1:00it's not super serious like I'm playing
1:01a show or I'm playing Falcon blue Tina
1:03also gets to learn does it makes can
1:05there as well so today's topic is going
1:07to be how is Lucina in the current meta
1:09game a character analysis now I've
1:12always had this different opinion with
1:14Lucena and previous fearlessness you've
1:16seen me like group leucine and Mars
1:18together and the reason I did that is
1:19not because I think that they're both
1:21the same character or both are just as
1:23good I do think that Mars is better than
1:25leucine apps and that is specifically
1:27because you can get more mileage out of
1:29the tippers you can just get more crazy
1:31clutch things out of it but Lucena isn't
1:33so far behind marks like I wouldn't put
1:36them like in a disappear like I would
1:37have paid like Lucena heights here and
1:39then marks like top top in the game I
1:41want to put them like 20 spots away or
1:43ten spots away but I do think that
1:44Lucena is somewhere close to mark but
1:47not like maybe right next to him I will
1:48say so for me it's almost impossible to
1:50think of like how to properly place
1:52lucina and appear loosely like okay I'm
1:54gonna say oh I'm going to put Mars let's
1:56say for example more I'm gonna give you
1:57a random example it is no foreshadow and
1:59already sent but I'm gonna say let's go
2:01to Mars that's eight right and then oh
2:03yeah okay I'm going to play Lucena at
2:05night or I'm going to put leucine at 12
2:07or 13 or 17 it's like it's so hard for
2:09me to properly come up with a number
2:10because
2:11Lucina as a character has seen very few
2:13results outside of certain top players
2:15like you've seen some very few top
2:17players like Mara for example the most
2:18vulnerable one pulling out with seen a
2:20hand there and game getting when to
2:21seeing a cat do it sometimes as well and
2:23then you have some other lucina players
2:25like I think the ones that made the most
2:27noise at Genesis was Cougar Asuma I'm
2:29sorry if I pronounced your name right by
2:31the way from what I understand he
2:32actually took aunt Ida Game three with
2:34Lucena so sometimes you'll see some
2:35Lucena players make some noises noise
2:37handler by the same time Mussina shit's
2:39pretty appears most people do prefer
2:41playing Mars so you have a much wider
2:43sample of results to properly judge a
2:45this is how good mark is right well it
2:47would Lucena hasn't happened yet because
2:49she hasn't had a chance to like properly
2:50prove herself we can't I can't really
2:52tell you oh yeah she's exactly in this
2:55book I personally think she's talked to
2:56you somewhere in Top Gear that's how I
2:58feel I see I feel like no matter what
3:00she's the top tier character based on
3:02her tools based on her moves her
3:03strength her consistency her match of
3:05spirit I think she should talk to your
3:06character however I am not sure and
3:08which spot I'm not sure of 12 15 10
3:11second board you know I have no idea
3:14it's just really really hard for me to
3:15properly place her somewhere now what
3:17makes Mussina I think Lucena is she's
3:19really interested to me because she is
3:20more I think she's more consistent on
3:22mark because while it is true that Mars
3:24can combo like sour spots into tippers
3:27and pepper to the tippers or like sour
3:28spots are sometimes like pretty good for
3:30marks I just feel like Mussina has a lot
3:31of scenarios were like for example all
3:33you back here somewhere Mars at 80 right
3:35here all you didn't get the tipper
3:37you know they they didn't die but like
3:39all you were like pretty next to them so
3:40you couldn't even get to tipperary if
3:42you tried on the scenario because you
3:43went further back here but you went for
3:44this back here with Lucy now right here
3:46right now he'll you know I find myself
3:47more playing in a lot of scenarios where
3:49I felt I got playing Mars and then I'm
3:51like well I want to kill with Lucina or
3:53that would have definitely killed or
3:54damn sometimes I'm playing Martha my
3:55line at tipper for smash at 30 and I'm
3:57like well you know there's my reward so
3:59I feel like Mussina has been
4:00consistently easier for me to get kills
4:03with and I feel like I'm I consistently
4:05play like my Peaks would Lucena aren't
4:07nearly as high as my marks but like I
4:09feel like I'm consistently at a higher
4:11level than my Mars I'm talking here from
4:12strictly personal experience by the way
4:14keep that in mind so when I play both
4:16characters I just feel slightly more
4:18consistent in the positive note with
4:20Lucena my Mars has lower lows and much
4:23higher highs so depending on how I
4:25playing if I'm playing super good that
4:26day and I'm loving all the tippers or
4:27not Martha should strictly more powerful
4:30but if I want if I want to validate
4:32consistency ll say because it doesn't
4:34matter where I land the hitboxes I'm
4:35always going to get the same result off
4:37of them and you know choking is the
4:38thing sometimes you miss space situation
4:40sometimes you can't line a paper because
4:42of how close the opponent is so yeah so
4:44that's that in my head it makes lucena
4:46or just when I play here it just makes
4:48me feel like I'm more consistent with
4:49the calculation so like sometimes when I
4:51played like lucena I'm Martha against
4:53top players I feel like I'm getting more
4:55consistent with lucena sometimes I like
4:56a to soccer player at 30% with Mars and
4:59then I get to suck the next match and
5:00they were lucena win both games like a1
5:02stock and 40% you know there's like true
5:04you may get more mileage out of Mars
5:06sometimes but I felt like with my
5:08results right at least in the matches
5:10that I've been playing right I get more
5:12consistency with Lucy now at the same
5:14time Lucy Knight just got damn strong
5:16like she's not nearly as strong as like
5:17marcipor so like consistently like she's
5:20just really strong I her first fresh
5:21feels like a 60 70 her back your skills
5:23like a 90 or 80 you know I would rage
5:26and her four kills pretty pretty pretty
5:28decently well as well her upper up smash
5:30or up tilt her side B even kills like
5:32like distilling in slept like okay I
5:34mean Mark Taper side B is actually not
5:36put like consistently for a side B to
5:38kill I got 120 like what Cena does I
5:40like it you know it feels consistent she
5:43also has a decent amount of mix-ups
5:44because she's more likely to for smash
5:47than Marx because any part of the forest
5:49much is going to wreck you it doesn't
5:50matter which part she gets it with
5:52because it's just more likely for her to
5:53like actually do damage for you
5:55depending on where you get hit because
5:56this will Cena so Mars will have to sort
5:58of calculate for smashes more and you
6:00can kind of foreshadow a little bit
6:01because you'll see more space to run in
6:02a certain range or Walker run in a
6:04certain way or throw a move to space out
6:06the range and then they're going to for
6:07so much but with Lucy net they're just
6:08going to force me you know they're just
6:10going to actually just force to it so
6:11that makes some of her smash attacks I
6:13guess I will say less predictable with
6:15loosing them they also both do really
6:17well in almost the same matches as well
6:19I mean they both do good against Mario
6:20Luigi they both look good against cloud
6:22they both do good I could steady Kong's
6:24they both struggle against Sheik so it
6:27does struggle at like will depending on
6:30who you talk to but like I feel like
6:31they both either go even with Bayonetta
6:33or they struggle with the internet
6:34depending on who you talk to but it's so
6:36solid you know like they don't get
6:37destroyed
6:38at least for sure and like a lot of
6:40people when they talk about Lucena
6:42they're like oh LOL go play martyr
6:44you're wasting your time but it's like
6:45people don't understand it the fact that
6:46there is merit to playing lucina because
6:49like i said before there's some
6:50scenarios where she may just meal formal
6:52she may feel more consistent or
6:53sometimes players reward more having a
6:55consistent head boxes or just sometimes
6:57players value more consistent head boxes
7:00rather than having like range or temper
7:03based head boxes you know like sometimes
7:04you do not strictly just do not feel
7:07comfortable playing with tipper head
7:09boxes you know some people just don't
7:10like playing with marks but at the same
7:11time they also want to play a circuit
7:13and I want to play something more
7:14consistent cloud for example doesn't
7:16have tipper
7:16head boxes right he doesn't like it's
7:18not like if you hit with the tip of his
7:20upper it does more damage and more knock
7:21back you know I mean he's will do
7:23gradually decreasing not for example few
7:25upper and then you weight slightly bit
7:27and then you hit the upper it would
7:28actually do less knock but like the weak
7:30spot of the upper right he does have
7:32that almost everyone in the game has
7:33that anyway so it's just natural to
7:35smash it's not like you have to land
7:36with a certain part of the head box when
7:37you throw it out and then you're gonna
7:38get a different fact so people are just
7:40not comfortable with that I I don't feel
7:41that comfortable with that either it's
7:43not like you can just say oh only bad
7:44players like playing with Lucena all
7:46like Lucena is like playing mark without
7:49playing mark you know it's like I feel
7:50like the stakes are kind of the root
7:51because here's the thing smash4 has
7:53almost 60 characters okay this character
7:55for almost every type of play I love
7:56that I like I like the variety I like
7:58that everyone can find a character that
8:00I like for example what if you wanted to
8:01play a short character that's not as
8:03crazy as cloud but not that one that has
8:05like tipper mechanics those Mars you
8:06want to play something one system more
8:08in the middle then you can pick a yam
8:09and I like that I feel like the game is
8:10variety and has a place for everyone to
8:12play I don't like how people like like
8:14to say all lucena stuck somewhere
8:15because she clearly doesn't suck she
8:17stopped your carriage she does well in
8:18the same amount of access that Marsh
8:19does so should I just look at it that
8:21way at the end of the day you should
8:22never sleep on either Martha Lucena they
8:24they both are really good characters for
8:26now they're super metagame right now
8:27both of them in my opinion and I just
8:30think that in the future we're going to
8:32see more of these characters because the
8:34characters are doing good right now
8:35because the game isn't get impact so now
8:37we're developing characters rather than
8:39like saying all this characters broken
8:40well she's going to get nerfed in the
8:41next patch let's not do any work towards
8:43solving the puzzle let's just wait for
8:45the nurse but now pretty much it hasn't
8:47beat a patch in forever so now we can
8:48understand that only something happens
8:50to the switch we have to actually deal
8:51with
8:51but the game is right now and actually
8:53figure it out or you know or do
8:54something about it but that's it I think
8:56characters are going to be being are
8:57going to get developed more characters
8:59people are going to focus more on
9:00developing their own tools and trying to
9:02figure our puzzles and working out
9:04solutions rather than complaining I felt
9:06like in the past with patches people
9:07were more focused on like oh whatever
9:08you know that's gonna get nervous I'll
9:10just do whatever done and it'll
9:12disappear I feel like a lot of people
9:13have that mindset but now it's like more
9:15like you either adapt or you deal with
9:17it and keep losing and a lot of people
9:19don't maybe not everyone has a problem
9:20with losing but a lot of people don't
9:21like losing so people have more of a I
9:24have to adapt to this problem and I feel
9:25like characters are being more perfected
9:28I'm more like people are kind of like
9:29moving out the edges of their characters
9:31now and I feel like lucena is a
9:32character that I sing in the future more
9:34top players are going to start using
9:35here and I think she's going to be used
9:37more encounter picks I think that more
9:38people are going to bring her up because
9:39there's all the top players that I know
9:41that don't like play and Marvel they
9:42like playing with scene and there's a
9:43lot of them that feel like you know why
9:44Palouse you know when you could play
9:45more you know so I see both people in
9:47both camps you know I'm more about
9:49looking at person you know I like
9:50playing we'll see now more than March
9:51personally for example so there's
9:53definitely more players like for example
9:54Niro likes playing Lucy nancydeb mark so
9:56yeah she definitely has a strong spot in
9:58the middle game I'm not exactly sure
9:59where in the tearless but she definitely
10:01deserves a spot and I think that she's
10:04gonna keep getting better she and Kaleo
10:06proved how good Martha so now we have to
10:08wait for that player that's going to
10:09prove a you know what Lucy there's also
10:10the map like check those out I think
10:12we'll see that eventually with that said
10:13thank you so much for watching as always
10:15everyone hope you have a good one
10:16zero out goodbye
