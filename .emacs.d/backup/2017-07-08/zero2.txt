actually super happy today because not only have I had an amazing day but at the same time I'm also really happy to talk about Lucena Latinas actually one of the cactus that I have the most fun with playing in smash 4 actually she's one of the characters that I guess you could say I play for fun when like you know it's not super serious like I'm playing a show or I'm playing Falcon blue Tina also gets to learn does it makes can there as well so today's topic is going to be how is Lucina in the current meta game a character analysis now I've always had this different opinion with Lucena and previous fearlessness you've seen me like group leucine and "Mars" together and the reason I did that is not because I think that they're both the same character or both are just as good I do think that "Mars" is better than leucine apps and that is specifically because you can get more mileage out of the tippers you can just get more crazy clutch things out of it but Lucena isn't so far behind marks like I wouldn't put them like in a disappear like I would have paid like Lucena heights here and then marks like top top in the game I want to put them like 20 spots away or ten spots away but I do think that Lucena is somewhere close to mark but not like maybe right next to him I will say so for me it's almost impossible to think of like how to properly place lucina and appear loosely like okay I'm gonna say oh I'm going to put "Mars" let's say for example more I'm gonna give you a random example it is no foreshadow and already sent but I'm gonna say let's go to "Mars" that's eight right and then oh yeah okay I'm going to play Lucena at night or I'm going to put leucine at 12 or 13 or 17 it's like it's so hard for me to properly come up with a number because Lucina as a character has seen very few results outside of certain top players like you've seen some very few top players like Mara for example the most vulnerable one pulling out with seen a hand there and game getting when to seeing a cat do it sometimes as well and then you have some other lucina players like I think the ones that made the most noise at Genesis was Cougar Asuma I'm sorry if I pronounced your name right by the way from what I understand he actually took aunt Ida Game three with Lucena so sometimes you'll see some Lucena players make some noises noise handler by the same time Mussina shit's pretty appears most people do prefer playing "Mars" so you have a much wider sample of results to properly judge a this is how good mark is right well it would Lucena hasn't happened yet because she hasn't had a chance to like properly prove herself we can't I can't really tell you oh yeah she's exactly in this book I personally think she's talked to you somewhere in Top Gear that's how I feel I see I feel like no matter what she's the top tier character based on her tools based on her moves her strength her consistency her match of spirit I think she should talk to your character however I am not sure and which spot I'm not sure of 12 15 10 second board you know I have no idea it's just really really hard for me to properly place her somewhere now what makes Mussina I think Lucena is she's really interested to me because she is more I think she's more consistent on mark because while it is true that "Mars" can combo like sour spots into tippers and pepper to the tippers or like sour spots are sometimes like pretty good for marks I just feel like Mussina has a lot of scenarios were like for example all you back here somewhere "Mars" at 80 right here all you didn't get the tipper you know they they didn't die but like all you were like pretty next to them so you couldn't even get to tipperary if you tried on the scenario because you went further back here but you went for this back here with Lucy now right here right now he'll you know I find myself more playing in a lot of scenarios where I felt I got playing "Mars" and then I'm like well I want to kill with Lucina or that would have definitely killed or damn sometimes 

I'm playing Martha my line at tipper for smash at 30 and I'm like well you know there's my reward so I feel like Mussina has been consistently easier for me to get kills with and I feel like I'm I consistently play like my Peaks would Lucena aren't nearly as high as my marks but like I feel like I'm consistently at a higher level than my "Mars" I'm talking here from strictly personal experience by the way keep that in mind so when I play both characters I just feel slightly more consistent in the positive note with Lucena my "Mars" has lower lows and much higher highs so depending on how I playing if I'm playing super good that day and I'm loving all the tippers or not Martha should strictly more powerful but if I want if I want to validate consistency ll say because it doesn't matter where I land the hitboxes I'm always going to get the same result off of them and you know choking is the thing sometimes you miss space situation sometimes you can't line a paper because of how close the opponent is so yeah so that's that in my head it makes lucena or just when I play here it just makes me feel like I'm more consistent with the calculation so like sometimes when I played like lucena I'm Martha against top players I feel like I'm getting more consistent with lucena sometimes I like a to soccer player at 30% with "Mars" and then I get to suck the next match and they were lucena win both games like a1 stock and 40% you know there's like true you may get more mileage out of "Mars" sometimes but I felt like with my results right at least in the matches that I've been playing right I get more consistency with Lucy now at the same time Lucy Knight just got damn strong like she's not nearly as strong as like marcipor so like consistently like she's just really strong I her first fresh feels like a 60 70 her back your skills like a 90 or 80 you know I would rage and her four kills pretty pretty pretty decently well as well her upper up smash or up tilt her side B even kills like like distilling in slept like okay I mean Mark Taper side B is actually not put like consistently for a side B to kill I got 120 like what Cena does I like it you know it feels consistent she also has a decent amount of mix-ups because she's more likely to for smash than Marx because any part of the forest much is going to wreck you it doesn't matter which part she gets it with because it's just more likely for her to like actually do damage for you depending on where you get hit because this will Cena so "Mars" will have to sort of calculate for smashes more and you can kind of foreshadow a little bit because you'll see more space to run in a certain range or Walker run in a certain way or throw a move to space out the range and then they're going to for so much but with Lucy net they're just going to force me you know they're just going to actually just force to it so that makes some of her smash attacks I guess I will say less predictable with loosing them they also both do really well in almost the same matches as well I mean they both do good against Mario Luigi they both look good against cloud they both do good I could steady Kong's they both struggle against Sheik so it does struggle at like will depending on who you talk to but like I feel like they both either go even with Bayonetta or they struggle with the internet depending on who you talk to but it's so solid you know like they don't get destroyed at least for sure and like a lot of people when they talk about Lucena they're like oh LOL go play martyr you're wasting your time but it's like people don't understand it the fact that there is merit to playing lucina because like i said before there's some scenarios where she may just meal formal she may feel more consistent or sometimes players reward more having a consistent head boxes or just sometimes players value more consistent head boxes rather than having like range or temper based head boxes you know like sometimes you do not strictly just do not feel comfortable playing with tipper head boxes you know some people just don't like playing with marks but at the same time they also want to play a circuit and I want to play something more consistent cloud for example doesn't have tipper head boxes right he doesn't like it's not like if you hit with the tip of his upper it does more damage and more knock back you know I mean he's will do gradually decreasing not for example few upper and then you weight slightly bit and then you hit the upper it would actually do less knock but like the weak spot of the upper right he does have that almost everyone in the game has that anyway so it's just natural to smash it's not like you have to land with a certain part of the head box when you throw it out and then you're gonna get a different fact so people are just not comfortable with that I I don't feel that comfortable with that either it's not like you can just say oh only bad players like playing with Lucena all like Lucena is like playing mark without playing mark you know it's like I feel like the stakes are kind of the root because here's the thing smash4 has almost 60 characters okay this character for almost every type of play I love that I like I like the variety I like that everyone can find a character that I like for example what if you wanted to play a short character that's not as crazy as cloud but not that one that has like tipper mechanics those "Mars" you want to play something one system more in the middle then you can pick a yam and I like that I feel like the game is variety and has a place for everyone to play I don't like how people like like to say all lucena stuck somewhere because she clearly doesn't suck she stopped your carriage she does well in the same amount of access that "Mars" does so should I just look at it that way at the end of the day you should never sleep on either Martha Lucena they they both are really good characters for now they're super metagame right now both of them in my opinion and I just think that in the future we're going to see more of these characters because the characters are doing good right now because the game isn't get impact so now we're developing characters rather than like saying all this characters broken well she's going to get nerfed in the next patch let's not do any work towards solving the puzzle let's just wait for the nurse but now pretty much it hasn't beat a patch in forever so now we can understand that only something happens to the switch we have to actually deal with but the game is right now and actually figure it out or you know or do something about it but that's it I think characters are going to be being are going to get developed more characters people are going to focus more on developing their own tools and trying to figure our puzzles and working out solutions rather than complaining I felt like in the past with patches people were more focused on like oh whatever you know that's gonna get nervous I'll just do whatever done and it'll disappear I feel like a lot of people have that mindset but now it's like more like you either adapt or you deal with it and keep losing and a lot of people don't maybe not everyone has a problem with losing but a lot of people don't like losing so people have more of a I have to adapt to this problem and I feel like characters are being more perfected I'm more like people are kind of like moving out the edges of their characters now and I feel like lucena is a character that I sing in the future more top players are going to start using here and I think she's going to be used more encounter picks I think that more people are going to bring her up because there's all the top players that I know that don't like play and Marvel they like playing with scene and there's a lot of them that feel like you know why Palouse you know when you could play more you know so I see both people in both camps you know I'm more about looking at person you know I like playing we'll see now more than March personally for example so there's definitely more players like for example Niro likes playing Lucy nancydeb mark so yeah she definitely has a strong spot in the middle game I'm not exactly sure where in the tearless but she definitely  deserves a spot and I think that she's gonna keep getting better she and Kaleo proved how good Martha so now we have to wait for that player that's going to prove a you know what Lucy there's also the map like check those out I think we'll see that eventually with that said thank you so much for watching as always everyone hope you have a good one
 zero out goodbye
